# ✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer satisfaction levels within an undisclosed airline company. By examining the quality of service and satisfaction rates, we aim to provide valuable insights into different aspects of the flying experience. The analysis is divided into three main sections to thoroughly understand the customer journey:

- **Pre-flight** 🛫
- **During flight** ✈️
- **Post-flight** 🛬

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to delve into the "During flight" experience to uncover factors that significantly impact customer satisfaction. The analysis will address the following key questions:

1. **How is satisfaction affected by class?** 🎫
   - Investigate whether passengers' satisfaction levels differ based on the class of service (e.g., Economy, Business, First Class).

2. **How is satisfaction affected by entertainment?** 🎥
   - Assess the impact of in-flight entertainment options on overall passenger satisfaction.

3. **How is satisfaction affected by food?** 🍽️
   - Examine how the quality and variety of food served during the flight influence customer satisfaction.

4. **How is satisfaction affected by distance?** 🌍
   - Analyze whether the duration of the flight affects satisfaction levels.

## Methodology

The analysis will utilize various data science techniques including statistical analysis and data visualization to explore and interpret the data. The goal is to identify patterns and trends that can help improve the overall flying experience for passengers.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes detailed records of customer feedback on various aspects of their flight experience. It provides a comprehensive view of satisfaction levels across different variables related to the "During flight" experience.
